<h2>A signature Dish in the Jamaican Culutre!</h2>
<p>
  This is the <strong>best oxtail</strong> recipe you’ll ever try. We must say,
  hands down Oxtail is our favorite Jamaican dish to cook and to EAT. The flavor
  that comes from the bone marrow is absolutely mind-blowing. The truth is,
  although it is our fave, we don’t really make it too often because it’s so
  expensive nowadays. But, when we do buy it we make sure to buy enough to last
  at least two days. If you know anything about leftovers you know that the
  second and third days are the best, especially with this bomb oxtail recipe,
  it tastes extra flavorful when it’s been soaking in all that gravy!!!.

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Wash Oxtails with Water and lime</li>
    <li>
      Now it’s time to season the oxtail with dry seasonings(if you can let it
      soak overnight, if not the least 30 mins)
    </li>
    <li>Add your oil to the pot, with 2 cloves of garlic, pimento</li>
    <li>Then Add oxtail to the pot and brown each side.</li>
    <li>
      As each one is browned put it on a paper towel to get rid of the excess
      oil.
    </li>
    <li>
      Now it’s time to add all your oxtail back into the pot Add water to the
      pot until the oxtails are fully covered. And season with onions,
      scallions, sweet pepper, thyme, Scotch Bonnet Pepper, Ginger, Ketchup, and
      bbq sauce( boil for 2-4 hours adding water every hour if needed)
    </li>
    <li>
      After each hour stick a fork in your oxtail to check the process. Because
      depending on the size of your meat the done time might vary.
    </li>
    <li>
      You will stay to see how thick the gravy is becoming after each hour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Season your meat one last time with onions, scallions, thyme, sweet
      pepper, more ketchup, dry seasonings, black pepper, salt, honey BBQ sauce
      add in butter beans (give it a stir)
    </li>
    <li>Let it boil for at least 10 more mins then you are ready to serve.</li>
